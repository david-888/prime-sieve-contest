# Prime Sieve Contest

This is a fun contest inspired by David Plummer.
I saw his youtube video and needed to try and compare some languages by myself.
Here you can find his exciting youtube video:

And here is his accompanying git repository:

I would like to compare some implementations in other languages with C++ and with each other.
